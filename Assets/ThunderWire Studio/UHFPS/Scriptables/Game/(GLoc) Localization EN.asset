        his days bound by labor and ties.\r\nIn a humble hut, under branches entwined,\r\nHe
        kept a doll, to which all his days he consigned.\r\n\r\nThis doll held a

        more worried about Nastenka. I've lived here, on the edge of the forest,
        for many years, and I've seen all sorts of things, but I still can't get
        used to the local people. The people here are peculiar, so steeped in old
        beliefs that sometimes you don't know what to think. Pagans, worshipping
        their ancient gods, Slavic gods of some kind. In the morning I hear them
        praising idols in the field. They're strange, closed people. The forest is
        a holy place for them. They say that in these thickets live Leshy, and in
        the swamp and Vodyanoy. They are sure that if you don't respect local customs,
        the forest spirits will punish you. It is hard for me to understand how one
        can believe in such things nowadays. Not far from the village there is an
        old Catholic church, almost empty. A monk built it 100 years ago, trying
        to bring these savages to the \u201Ctrue faith\u201D. But it didn't work
        out. The locals go there only when a funeral has to be held, they believe
        in Perun, but they bury the bodies, they don't burn them. But even then,
        on the way to church, they don't forget to leave bread at the doorstep for
        the housekeeper. They live like that - between two worlds, and they are not
        sure about either of them. My daughter Nastenka has begun to take an interest
        in their paganism. She is growing up, and the world around her begins to
        attract her more and more, especially what seems alien and incomprehensible.
        She sees how idols dance, weave amulets, and she is also interested. But
        I, as a father, try not to fill her head with it. I forbid her to go to them,
        I take her to church. It's empty there, but it's better to let her go to
        a holy place than to hide in the forest behind their idols. I'm afraid she'll
        be attracted to these strange beliefs. "

        I tried going to church, praying, asking God for comfort, but nothing helps.
        I kneel in front of the altar, but inside there is only pain and despair.
        I see her face in front of me, her smile, and I realize that I will never
        hear her laugh again. How do I live with that? Often I think it would be
        easier to go after her, just disappear and let it be over. I don't resist
        the thought of death anymore - it seems like the only way out of this endless
        agony. All I was left with was hopelessness and a desire to go somewhere
        where there was no more pain, where I could meet her.I started asking the
        locals what I should do. At first I was afraid they would be judgmental,
        but it was easier to talk to someone. I told them what I was thinking, that
        I couldn't see a way out. All as one say that in the death of Nastenka may
        be to blame Slavic spirits. I didn't believe it at first, I thought they
        were just joking or mocking. But they spoke seriously, with a kind of terrible
        certainty. According to them, the area around the farm has always been the
        abode of monsters and entities that are older than time itself. I didn't
        believe it before, I thought it was all just a fairy tale for the naive.
        But now that Nastenka has disappeared, I'm beginning to doubt it. What if
        the locals are right? What if the very monsters or spirits the villagers
        fear are to blame for her disappearance? I'm sitting here now and I don't
        know what to do. On the one hand, I'd like to end this torment once and for
        all. But on the other hand. If it's really the work of these monsters, maybe
        I can get her back. Maybe I should follow in their footsteps. I'm scared
        to even think about it, but I'd do anything for Nastenka. Maybe she can still
        be saved. Maybe I haven't lost everything. I don't know what will happen
        next. My strength is almost gone, but I have to keep going. For her sake.

        gear, gasoline and other important stuff.\r\n Then we decided to put a combination
        lock so that we wouldn't lose the keys, and so that we wouldn't forget the
        code, we wrote it down right here. But not just like that, but with a funny
        story, so that you can even confuse it with a hangover!\r\n So, our code
        is like this: 5-3-4-2. And we came up with it after Petrovich stepped into
        the water with his heel while fishing, spat into the water three times, calmed
        down four times with signs and took a sip of cognac twice \u2013 so remember:
        5-3-4-2.While Petrovich was swimming out, I wrote down this code on the door.
        Enter it boldly, but just don't forget to sit before it, skip a glass and
        tell a joke \u2013 they say it helps to remember better!"

      Text: "Listen, Vasilich, I've heard that people are cooing about power outages.
        Here's the thing, in short... I was sitting at the station one evening, so
        I already missed a couple of mugs of moonshine, and suddenly the light goes
        out, and I hear squeaky laughter from somewhere out of the corner of my ear.
        Well, I think, kapets, the brownie has taken over again. I remembered with
        fright the story of how Alyosha then forgot to appease the brownie. That's
        where it started! The light bulbs in all the houses flashed like fireworks,
        and a brownie peeks around the corner and laughs.Well, I was scared and immediately
        poured the whole bottle of moonshine into a jar for him and put it behind
        the gate. In short\u2026 I've put a lock on the gate now, otherwise there
        won't be enough water for it. The password to the lock is: 6954"

      Text: "There is a rumor that the swamps behind the village are home to an effeminate
        underwater creature. The locals believe it is a waterman. He beckons passers-by
        to his bog and persuades them to take a dip in the silt. If the passerby
        disrespects the waterman's request, he crawls out of his abode to teach the
        uninvited guest a lesson. I personally saw how this creature rushed at me,
        grabbed his slimy hand by the leg and tried to drag me into the drowns, but
        if you move away, it will not pursue you, the main thing to get away as soon
        as possible....\r\n For some unknown reason, these murky waters seem to be
        able to fill the minds of some weak-willed people with their mud. And, if
        you give in to temptation, the waterman will seem like a beautiful mermaid
        and the depths of the swamps like an underwater paradise... You must keep
        your composure and in no case try not to approach this false paradise and
        do not set foot in it."

      Text: "Isn't everyone familiar with this little furry dwarf who maintains harmony

        has a dark side. If a person does not monitor his household, does not feed
        and does not thank the smoke, and also if he defiles his possessions for
        no reason, then the brownie can get angry very quickly. Angered, this little
        monster will start to scare and frighten his enemy, and, among other things,
        will sneak up on him in order to cause physical harm.\r\n Despite his leprosy,
        the brownie, by nature, is quiet and reclusive and does not tolerate human

      Text: Do you believe in ghosts? The answer doesn't matter if one of them definitely
        exists. And this is not some kind of village legend. Everyone who has visited
        these parts will confirm that there is an invisible entity in the local church
        and its surroundings that does not let strangers get too close. If certain
        boundaries are violated, she begins to throw objects, push unwanted guests
        to the ground and even lift them into the air.The locals nicknamed the ghost
        ovinnik, and although it may not be easy to appease him, it is quite possible
        to do so. All you need to do is make the right offering to the sacred idols
        that sit on the field. Locals often cajole them to dispel the fog in their
        soul, but to ward off the dark essence. After the offering, the ovinnik will
        no longer consider you an outsider and will allow you to move around its
        territory.

      Text: "Did Chernobog himself rise to us from hell in order to curse us for
        our sins? With my own eyes, I saw a black goat-wolf face looking at me from
        across the street. At the same moment, a terrible sound rang in my head,
        as if hundreds of tortured souls were screaming, moaning, begging for help.
        But what if I told you that the devil came to me more than once and changed
        his color every time?The second time I met him in the night forest, he changed
        his clothes from black to brown, but the look remained the same... The screams
        are still the same... Suddenly my flashlight went out. My chest ached, I
        couldn't move from fear. The devil, looking directly at me, crossed two fingers
        and, like Viy, summoned his faithful minions. In the darkness of the night,
        I could only see bizarre silhouettes, but even they made the hairs on my
        head stand on end. I don't know what saved me that day, whether it was the
        will of the pantheon or the first rays of dawn.No matter how much I wished
        for a third meeting, it did happen.I walked through the fog and mist, my
        heart beating in time with the fear that filled me from the inside. Everything
        around me seemed strange, distorted, as if space itself had decided to play
        a cruel joke on me. Every tree, every stone, every turn in the forest\u2013everything
        led me back to the same place.And so, among the shadows and nightmares, I
        saw her. My wife stood there, innocent and serene, as if all this darkness
        around her did not exist. She looked at me with her trusting eyes. I took
        a step towards her, hoping that this was just a figment of my imagination,
        that I could destroy this horror with a simple touch on her hand.But as soon
        as I got closer, her face twisted into a terrible grimace, and the screams
        of souls filled my head again. Devilish laughter came from everywhere, and
        my wife was no longer in front of me. The devil, mocking me, disappeared,
        leaving behind only the sounds of suffering and his terrible mockery.At that
        moment, I realized that our nightmare was far from over. The devil can play
        with us like with dolls. And every time I think I'm close to a solution,
        he finds a new way to sow fear and despair in my soul."
